# hubitat-SonosAlbumArt
 This is an application that allows you to select a sonos device and then creates a tile for use in dashboards with the album art for the playing track for use with HUBITAT

It has a dependency on the File Manager Device written by thebearmay so install that first from Hubitat Package Manager
